# **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) Interview Questions & Answers**  

## **1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**  
✅ **Answer:** OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of **objects**, which contain data (attributes) and methods (functions). It enables better modularity, code reusability, and security.  

---

## **2. What are the four main principles of OOP?**  
✅ **Answer:**  
1. **Encapsulation** – Hiding data and restricting direct access.  
2. **Abstraction** – Hiding implementation details and exposing only functionality.  
3. **Inheritance** – Reusing code from a parent class in a child class.  
4. **Polymorphism** – A single method can have multiple behaviors.  

---

## **3. What is the difference between class and object?**  
✅ **Answer:**  
- **Class**: A blueprint or template for creating objects.  
- **Object**: An instance of a class with specific values assigned to attributes.  

**Example:**  
```cpp
class Car {
public:
    string brand;
    int speed;
};
int main() {
    Car myCar;  // Object
    myCar.brand = "Tesla";
    myCar.speed = 200;
}
```

---

## **4. What is encapsulation? Give an example.**  
✅ **Answer:** Encapsulation hides internal details and allows controlled access using **getter and setter** methods.  

```cpp
class BankAccount {
private:
    double balance;
public:
    void setBalance(double amount) { balance = amount; }
    double getBalance() { return balance; }
};
```

---

## **5. What is abstraction? How is it different from encapsulation?**  
✅ **Answer:**  
- **Abstraction** hides unnecessary details and only exposes essential features.  
- **Encapsulation** hides data members using access specifiers.  

```cpp
class Shape {
public:
    virtual void draw() = 0;  // Abstract method
};
class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() override { cout << "Drawing a Circle" << endl; }
};
```

---

## **6. What is inheritance? Explain with an example.**  
✅ **Answer:** Inheritance allows a class to acquire properties and behaviors of another class.  

```cpp
class Animal {
public:
    void sound() { cout << "Animal sound" << endl; }
};
class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void bark() { cout << "Bark" << endl; }
};
```

---

## **7. What are the types of inheritance in C++?**  
✅ **Answer:**  
1. **Single Inheritance** – One child inherits from one parent.  
2. **Multiple Inheritance** – A child inherits from multiple parents.  
3. **Multilevel Inheritance** – A child inherits from a derived class.  
4. **Hierarchical Inheritance** – Multiple classes inherit from a single class.  
5. **Hybrid Inheritance** – A combination of different inheritance types.  

---

## **8. What is function overloading?**  
✅ **Answer:** Multiple functions with the same name but different parameters.  

```cpp
class Math {
public:
    int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }
    double add(double a, double b) { return a + b; }
};
```

---

## **9. What is function overriding?**  
✅ **Answer:** A child class provides a new definition of a method from the parent class.  

```cpp
class Animal {
public:
    virtual void sound() { cout << "Animal sound" << endl; }
};
class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void sound() override { cout << "Bark" << endl; }
};
```

---

## **10. What is a virtual function in C++?**  
✅ **Answer:** A **virtual function** enables **runtime polymorphism** by allowing function overriding in derived classes.  

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual void show() { cout << "Base class" << endl; }
};
class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void show() override { cout << "Derived class" << endl; }
};
```

---

## **11. What is an abstract class?**  
✅ **Answer:** An **abstract class** contains at least one **pure virtual function** and cannot be instantiated.  

```cpp
class Shape {
public:
    virtual void draw() = 0;  // Pure virtual function
};
```

---

## **12. What is the difference between abstract class and interface?**  
✅ **Answer:**  
- **Abstract Class:** Can have both abstract and concrete methods.  
- **Interface (in Java):** Only contains abstract methods.  

---

## **13. What is the difference between compile-time and runtime polymorphism?**  
✅ **Answer:**  
| Feature              | Compile-Time Polymorphism | Run-Time Polymorphism |
|----------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Definition          | Function overloading    | Function overriding |
| Binding            | Early binding (static)  | Late binding (dynamic) |
| Example            | Overloaded functions    | Virtual functions |

---

## **14. What is a constructor and destructor?**  
✅ **Answer:**  
- **Constructor:** A function that initializes an object.  
- **Destructor:** A function that destroys an object when it goes out of scope.  

```cpp
class Example {
public:
    Example() { cout << "Constructor called" << endl; }
    ~Example() { cout << "Destructor called" << endl; }
};
```

---

## **15. What is the “this” pointer in C++?**  
✅ **Answer:** The `this` pointer holds the address of the calling object.  

```cpp
class Example {
public:
    void show() { cout << "Address: " << this << endl; }
};
```

---

## **16. What is multiple inheritance? Give an example.**  
✅ **Answer:** A child class inherits from **multiple parent classes**.  

```cpp
class A { public: void showA() { cout << "Class A" << endl; } };
class B { public: void showB() { cout << "Class B" << endl; } };
class C : public A, public B {};
```

---

## **17. What is operator overloading?**  
✅ **Answer:** It allows us to redefine operators for user-defined types.  

```cpp
class Complex {
public:
    int real, imag;
    Complex operator+(const Complex& c) {
        Complex temp;
        temp.real = real + c.real;
        temp.imag = imag + c.imag;
        return temp;
    }
};
```

---

## **18. What is deep copy and shallow copy?**  
✅ **Answer:**  
- **Shallow Copy:** Copies object references, leading to shared data.  
- **Deep Copy:** Creates new memory allocation to avoid shared references.  

```cpp
class Deep {
    int* data;
public:
    Deep(int val) { data = new int(val); }
    Deep(const Deep& other) { data = new int(*other.data); }  // Deep Copy
    ~Deep() { delete data; }
};
```

---

## **19. What is friend function in C++?**  
✅ **Answer:** A **friend function** can access private and protected members of a class.  

```cpp
class Sample {
private:
    int data;
public:
    friend void showData(Sample obj);
};
void showData(Sample obj) { cout << obj.data; }
```
